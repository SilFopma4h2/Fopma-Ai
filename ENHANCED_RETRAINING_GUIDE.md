- **Better Optimization**: Improved learning rate scheduling and gradient handling

## 🔧 How to Use Enhanced Retraining

### Option 1: Use Main Modular Script (Recommended)
```bash
python main_modular.py
```

### Option 2: Use Original Script (Now Enhanced)
```bash
python main.py
```

### Option 3: Use in Your Code
```python
from fopma_ai.training import EnhancedTrainer
from fopma_ai.utils.config import get_training_config

# Get enhanced configuration (100 epochs, optimized settings)
config = get_training_config()
print(f"Training for {config['num_epochs']} epochs with enhanced data!")

# Create and use trainer
trainer = EnhancedTrainer(model, tokenizer, device, config)
losses = trainer.train(dataloader)
```

## 📊 What to Expect During Training

### Training Progress
- **Clear Milestones**: Progress updates at 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100%
- **Real-time Metrics**: Loss, learning rate, and step information
- **Improvement Tracking**: Shows percentage improvement between epochs
- **Time Estimates**: Approximate training time remaining

### Example Output

## 🔍 Monitoring Training Progress

### Real-time Feedback
- **Progress Bars**: Visual progress for each epoch
- **Loss Tracking**: Current and average loss values
- **Learning Rate**: Dynamic learning rate monitoring
- **Step Counter**: Total training steps completed

### Milestone Reporting
- **10% Complete**: First major checkpoint
- **25% Complete**: Quarter progress milestone  
- **50% Complete**: Halfway point celebration
- **75% Complete**: Three-quarters milestone
- **90% Complete**: Nearly complete warning
- **100% Complete**: Training completion summary

## 🛠️ Customizing Training

### Adjust Epochs
```python
from fopma_ai.utils.config import get_training_config

config = get_training_config()
config['num_epochs'] = 200  # Even more epochs!
```

### Adjust Data Amount
```python
from fopma_ai.utils.config import get_data_config

config = get_data_config()
config['sample_size'] = 100000  # Even more data!
```

### Custom Training Loop
```python
from fopma_ai.training import EnhancedTrainer

# Create custom configuration
custom_config = {
    'learning_rate': 2e-4,
    'num_epochs': 150,
    'batch_size': 8,
    # ... other settings
}

trainer = EnhancedTrainer(model, tokenizer, device, custom_config)
training_losses = trainer.train(dataloader)
```

## 🎉 Expected Results

With the enhanced retraining (100 epochs + 5x data):
- **Better Language Understanding**: More coherent text generation
- **Improved Fluency**: Smoother, more natural conversations
- **Better Context**: Enhanced ability to maintain conversation context
- **Reduced Repetition**: Less repetitive text output
- **Higher Quality**: Overall improvement in text quality

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Training Time
- **100 epochs**: Expect longer training time (~10-12 hours)
- **Progress Saves**: Training can be resumed from checkpoints
- **GPU Recommended**: Much faster with CUDA-enabled GPU

### Memory Requirements
- **Minimum**: 8GB RAM
- **Recommended**: 16GB+ RAM for smooth training
- **GPU Memory**: 4GB+ VRAM for optimal performance

### Troubleshooting
- **Out of Memory**: Reduce batch_size to 2 or 1
- **Slow Training**: Use GPU acceleration if available
- **Long Training**: Training saves checkpoints automatically

## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Quick enhanced retraining
python main_modular.py

# Check enhanced configuration
python -c "from fopma_ai.utils.config import get_training_config; print(get_training_config())"

# Monitor training progress
tail -f training.log  # If logging to file
```

## 🔄 Retraining Best Practices

1. **Use GPU**: Enable CUDA for faster training
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for loss reduction trends
3. **Save Regularly**: Keep checkpoint files safe
4. **Validate Results**: Test model quality after training
5. **Experiment**: Try different configurations for your use case
